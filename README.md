# Discord-Vanity-Searcher
This is just a silly little project I made to look for Discord Vanities, it is quite slow, however it runs into 0 ratelimits.

## Installation

1. Install Python from https://python.org, it must be above version 3.9. Downloading latest (3.11) is reccomended.

1. Click the Green Code Button.

2. Click the download zip file button.

3. Drag it to your desktop.

4. Now open up terminal and then type

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Now put all of your vanities you would like to check in the `vanity.txt` file. 

6. Finally, run the main.py file.
